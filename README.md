 What is this, anyway?
 Short answer: Looking for a "relatively" stable place to serve up a blog and notifications on when
 and where I will be teaching the Cloud Forensics Challenge.  If there's room, I can move my forensic
 images here; otherwise they will still be hosted with Google or Dropbox.  Otherwise expect this to be
 a MAJOR work-in-progress as I continue to learn the inner workings of GitHub for myself.  Please do NOT clone
 this or any other repository without my explicit written permission.  Unless I know you personally AND you're
 offering your services to help me and don't expect any payment in return, don't ask.
